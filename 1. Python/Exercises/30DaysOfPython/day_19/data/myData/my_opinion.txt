Hi! there, my name is S.deva manikanta, and I am thriving to learn python and it's fundamentals, and here I found a github repository. 
Where this repository is called as '30-Days-Of-Python'. I have seen lots of courses but the approach of this course is beaten every 
other course out there. This course provides a comprehensive walkthrough of various python topics and gives a very 
modular content in a structure manner, so that the learner can easily learn maximum out of python in short span. 
The best part of this course is they are provided very practical knowledge enhanceble exercise based on difficulty like  
level-1, level-2, level-3, these exercises are so good, which nearly enhanced my practical coding skill. 
I am very thankful to 'Asabeneh Yetayeh' for providing such a comprehensive repository for python.
