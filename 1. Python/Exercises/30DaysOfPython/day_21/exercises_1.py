#Task 1:
# Python has the module called statistics and we can use this module to do all the statistical calculations. 
# However, to learn how to make function and reuse function let us try to develop a program, which calculates the 
# measure of central tendency of a sample (mean, median, mode) and measure of variability (range, variance, standard deviation). 
# In addition to those measures, find the min, max, count, percentile, and frequency distribution of the sample. 
# You can create a class called Statistics and create all the functions that do statistical calculations as methods for the Statistics class.
# you output should look like this
#print(data.describe())
# Count: 25
# Sum:  744
# Min:  24
# Max:  38
# Range:  14
# Mean:  30
# Median:  29
# Mode:  (26, 5)
# Variance:  17.5
# Standard Deviation:  4.2
# Frequency Distribution: [(20.0, 26), (16.0, 27), (12.0, 32), (8.0, 37), (8.0, 34), (8.0, 33), (8.0, 31), (8.0, 24), (4.0, 38), (4.0, 29), (4.0, 25)]
